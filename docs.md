Scratchmark doesn't try for full compatibility with Markdown. According to
[Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is

But Markdown also allows writers to be quite lazy with indentation, even
though that might affect readability negatively. This version of markdown supports
readability by being a little more strict than many Markdown dialects, including
original Markdown. The increased strictness also makes the link between Markdown and
the subsequent HTML a bit easier to follow when it goes wrong.
